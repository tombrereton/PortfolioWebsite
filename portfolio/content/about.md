Hi I'm Tom and I'm a software engineer.

From an early age I enjoyed problem solving, computers, and building things. So I went down the path of Civil Engineering and completed my Bachelor's for it in 2013.

During my time as a civil engineer I got more and more involved in design automation and exploring the realm of programming. I started off with VBA, then moved to Python, and finally completed CS50 course which solidified my decision to make software engineering my career.

Since then, I've been completing a MSc in computer science at the University of Birmingham. I have thoroughly enjoyed all the subjects, particularly machine learning.

I'm also a member of UBRobotics, a society where we build a robot to compete in the Eurobot competition starting in April.
